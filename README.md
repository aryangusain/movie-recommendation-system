# Movie Recommendation System

## Introduction

This is a simple movie recommendation system built using Pandas, NumPy, and Streamlit. The system uses the TMDB movie dataset to recommend similar movies based on user input.

## How it Works

1. The user inputs the name of a movie.
2. The system analyzes the dataset to find movies similar to the user's input.
3. The system recommends the top 5 similar movies to the user.

## Technologies Used

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): For data manipulation and analysis.
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/): For numerical operations.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): For creating interactive web applications.

## Dataset

The system uses the TMDB movie dataset, which contains information about various movies.
